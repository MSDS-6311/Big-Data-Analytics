Think of the following questions. 

## Questions
1. What are the principal differences between NewSQL database such as CockroachDB or Google Spanner and traditional relational database systems such as Postgres or Oracle?
2. What is the role of consensus algorithms such as Raft in distributed databases?
3. Describe the CAP Theorem and how NewSQL database systems shift the tradeoffs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
