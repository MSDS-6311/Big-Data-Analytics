# Assignment 2. Hashing

Hash functions find wide use in Data Science.  

Some uses include: 
1. In software, hash functions are used to organize data for fast lookup in data structures known as hash tables or associative arrays. An example of such data structure is the `dict` data type in Python.
1. Data integrity checking. A hash can be used as a checksum to verify that the contents of a file has not been changed. Unlike simple sums, hashes are difficult to manipulate. 
1. As identifiers for data items. [UUIDs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html) (universally unique identifiers) are generated with the help of hash functions. 
1. [Cryptography and cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), including [cryptocurrency](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hash-functions-explained)
1. For data partitioning (e.g. [Hadoop](https://data-flair.training/blogs/hadoop-partitioner-tutorial/) and [database sharding](https://blog.yugabyte.com/how-data-sharding-works-in-a-distributed-sql-database/))
