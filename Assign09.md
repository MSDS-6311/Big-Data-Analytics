Learn about Style Transfer


1. Fork https://github.com/MSDS-6311/uh-demo in your github account and clone it on your instance. 
2. Run `StyleTransfer.ipynb`
3. Create a new notebook designing a new datajoint schema that catalogs something (e.g. famous people, fine art, your own photos), then downloads photos from URLs, applies style transfers, and plots a selection of results.

Note: you will need to install `cv2` using the command (on Ubuntu): 
```shell
$ sudo apt install python3-opencv
