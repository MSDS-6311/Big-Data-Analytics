# Computational Data Pipelines

* Continuing from assigment 8, build a computational workflow that creates a collection of images, applies style transfers to them, and display the results  
* 

## Build computational pipelines 
1. Fork https://github.com/MSDS-6311/StyleTransfer in your github account and clone it on your instance. 
2. In notebooks Run `States.ipynb`
3. Add a new computed table, `StateHSV` computing the average hue, saturation, and value of the flags.
4. Plot the US States flags ordered by hue.

## Submitting the homework 
Submit your work by committing it in your StyleTransfer repository and pushing it to your gith to your github repo.
