* Chapter 3: Backpropagation - https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U
* Chapter 4: Backpropagation calculus - https://youtu.be/tIeHLnjs5U8

## Questions 
1. What does it mean to train a network? What's the output of training? 
2. What is the basic mechanism of the network learning from data? 
3. What is the loss function? What are its inputs and what is its output? 
4. What operation does each node of a neural network perform?
4. What are activation functions?
5. How is gradient descent used in deep learning? 
6. What is the purpose of backpropagation? 
7. What are the main features of the deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow? 
8. What are tensors used for in deep learning frameworks? 
9. What kinds of problems can deep learning solve?
